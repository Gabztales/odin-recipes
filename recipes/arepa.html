    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The arepas are a very popular, even traditional and typical, <strong>flat round cornmeal cake</strong>
    Arepas can be made with various fillings, incuding meat, cheese, butter, ham, avocados, and so many other ingredients.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups lukewarm water.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>2 cups pre-cooked white corn meal (such as P.A.N.).</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a bowl. Gradually stir corn meal into water with your fingers until mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 golf ball-size balls and pat each one into a patty about 3/8-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook corn patties in hot oil until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice halfway through each cake horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
        <li>Fill it with the filling that you want</li>
    </ol>
